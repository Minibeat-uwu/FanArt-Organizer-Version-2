# FanArt Organizer Version 2
 An upgraded version of the fanart organizer using python as the base.
 There are 2 stages:
 1) Visual base organizer using machine learning/neural network.
 2) Frequent itemset 

It's only in the skeleton form and all the functions are seperated. **Still not user friendly**

**Also, you will need to download the neural network model from this wonderful guy here!**
The first stage uses KichangKim's pre-trained model (Thank you for giving us this beautiful stuff), so download (resnet-custom-v1 (current web version)) before using it.

But if you want to play around with the code, go right ahead.
