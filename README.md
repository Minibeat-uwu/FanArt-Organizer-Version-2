# FanArt Organizer Version 2
 An upgraded version of the fanart organizer using python as the base.
 There are 2 stages:
 1) Visual base organizer using machine learning/neural network.
 2) Frequent itemset 

It's only in the skeleton form and all the functions are seperated. **Still not user friendly**
